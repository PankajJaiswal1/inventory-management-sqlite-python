# SQLite Data Ingestion System using Python

## Project Description
This project implements a simple and reliable data ingestion system using Python and SQLite.  
It demonstrates how structured data can be loaded into a relational database using Pandas and SQLAlchemy, with logging enabled to track execution and errors.

The project is intended for learning, academic work, and small-scale database applications.

## Problem Statement
Managing structured data efficiently requires a reliable database system.  
This project addresses the need to ingest data into a lightweight database using Python while maintaining simplicity, clarity, and traceability.

---

## Project Objectives
- To ingest structured data into an SQLite database
- To use Pandas for data handling
- To manage database connections using SQLAlchemy
- To implement logging for monitoring execution
- To follow clean and modular coding practices

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite
- Pandas
- SQLAlchemy
- Logging module
- Power BI

## Working Methodology
1. Input data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame  
2. A connection to the SQLite database is established  
3. Data is inserted into database tables using `to_sql()`  
4. Logging records execution details and errors  
5. Data is stored persistently in the database
