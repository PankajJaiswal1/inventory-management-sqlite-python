# Vendor Performance & Inventory Optimization Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes vendor performance, inventory efficiency, and profitability using historical purchase and sales data.  
The goal is to identify inefficiencies in pricing, inventory turnover, and vendor dependency, and to provide data-driven recommendations for improving overall business profitability.

The analysis focuses on understanding sales contribution, profit margins, bulk purchasing benefits, and inventory movement across vendors.

## Business Problem
Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail and wholesale industry.  
Poor pricing strategies, slow inventory turnover, and over-reliance on a small number of vendors can lead to reduced profitability and higher operational risk.

This project addresses these challenges by analyzing vendor-level data to support better decision-making.

## Objectives
- Identify underperforming brands requiring pricing or promotional adjustments  
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit  
- Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit cost savings  
- Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs  
- Compare profitability between high- and low-performing vendors  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains vendor-level purchase and sales information, including:
- Purchase price and actual selling price  
- Total purchase and sales quantities  
- Sales revenue, gross profit, and profit margin  
- Freight costs and inventory turnover metrics

- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- CSV files
- Power BI

## Methodology
1. Performed data cleaning and filtering to remove zero and negative profit records  
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand distributions and outliers  
3. Analyzed correlations between pricing, sales, profit, and inventory turnover  
4. Evaluated vendor contribution to purchases and sales concentration  
5. Applied statistical testing to validate profit margin differences

## Key Insights
- Identified **198 low-sales but high-margin brands** suitable for targeted promotions  
- Found that the **top 10 vendors contribute 65.69% of total purchases**, indicating vendor dependency risk  
- Observed **72% lower unit costs** for bulk purchases, supporting cost-efficient procurement  
- Detected **$2.71M worth of unsold inventory**, highlighting slow-moving stock issues  
- Confirmed statistically significant differences in profit margins between high- and low-performing vendors  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Optimize pricing for low-sales, high-margin brands to increase volume  
- Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce supply-chain risk  
- Leverage bulk purchasing strategies for cost reduction  
- Improve inventory planning to reduce slow-moving stock  
- Enhance marketing and distribution strategies for low-performing vendors
